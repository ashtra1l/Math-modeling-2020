# Setting up your computer for Math modeling class

Below you will find summaries for setup of software and **Github** repositories for *Mathematical Modeling of Geological Processes.* 

Code in the class will be written in the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. **Python** is a general purpose programming language that can be used to do all kinds of things (write computer games, generate websites, data analysis and visualization, and even for *mathematical modeling!*). There are many packages available for Python that extend its basic functionality. We will need many of these packages for the exercises in this course. To make our lives easier, we will install a specific *distribution* of Python called **Anaconda**, which includes most of the packages that we will need for scientific programming in Python and also includes a variety of other useful software, such as a package management software called **conda**, which we can use to install any other packages we might need.

## Anaconda python distribution

The individual version of **Anaconda**  is free, meaning that you can easily transfer the tools that you learn in this course to wherever you find yourself working in the future (*no need for expensive licenses, e.g. as with Matlab or other similar programming languages*). 

To download and install Anaconda using this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Chose the installer for your OS, and make sure you *install Python 3 as opposed to Python 2*, that is, the installer should be Python 3.x of some variety. It gives a choice for 32-bit vs 64-bit. Most of you probably have 64-bit machines, so chose this option unless you know that you have a 32-bit machine. 

You can find some general information about using Anaconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/).

## Visual Studio Code (or VS Code)

**VS Code** is what is called an [interactive development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or **IDE**. It is a text editor for coding that is combined with a lot of additional functionality that makes writing, reading, running, and debugging code easier. This software is also free. When working with Python code in this class, we will primarily use VS Code.

You can find information on downloading and installing VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

There is extensive documentation on using VS Code. A good place to start is this [set of videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos). In particular, I suggest you watch the **Getting Started** video, which takes you through the install process and the **Extensions** video, which will show you how to install extensions. There is also a portion of the User Manual [that explains how to install extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

For this course you will need the following extensions to be installed:

* Python
* Anaconda Extension Pack
* GitHub Pull Requests and Issues
* GitLens
* Live Share
* Live Share Audio
* Live Share Extension Pack

Use the instructions found at the links above to install these extensions within your copy of VS Code.

Anaconda also comes with another IDE called **[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)**. This is also a quite capable IDE, but it does not have some of the interactive capabilities that we will use in class.

## Git and Github

**Git** is a [distributed version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control). It allows us to keep track of changes within our code by creating shapshots of that code (called commits) at different points in time. This can be incredibly useful if you mess something up in your code and want to revert to an older version. However, it also helps you to keep track of progress or go back and see the history of your changes. 

**Github** is an online server where you can publish your git repositories. This is important because it creates an online backup of your work. It also makes it easier to share your code with others. In fact, Git and Github really shine when you have a team of programmers working on the same code. It provides a very useful workflow for collaborative programming.

### Git-it

[Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) is a desktop app that provides a brief tutorial to the process of installing and using git. Read through the intro page at the above link and then go to the [releases section to download Git-it](http://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases).

To prepare yourself for using Git in class, go through the first 6 "challenges" provided by Git-it, ending with "Forks and Clones". This is the last section that is crucial for getting set up for class. 

Git-it requires some usage of the **terminal**, though most of this is explained within the tutorials. 

#### **Windows**

To open a terminal in Windows (after installing Git) go to the search menu and start typing Git. Look for the executable called **Git Bash**. This will provide a bash shell that would be same as what you would get in Linux or MacOS. Using this version of the shell will assure that we all can use the same commands.

#### **MacOS**

To open a terminal on a Mac, see [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac).

## Setting up git repositories for class

In class, we will use two different git repositories. One is a **main class repository** that contains code that I provide and/or create during lectures. This *is* that main repository (Math-modeling-2020).  

The second repository will be your **own repository** where you store and track your own code. I also recommend that you create a separate repository specifically for your project, as this would help to separate out your project code from your in-class and homework code.

### Organizing your repos

You will want to decide where to put your class git repos. My suggestion is that you create a directory (i.e. folder) within your `Documents` directory called `Math-Modeling` and then put the repos within this directory (each repo will be in its own directory that has the same name as the repo). The name of the main course repo is `Math-modeling-2020`. You will want to chose a different name for your own repository so that the directory names don't conflict (e.g. `my-math-modeling-code` would be one option). Repo names can't have spaces.

To navigate among these directories from the terminal, you will need to use the `cd` command (change directory). This is the terminal-based equivalent of navigating around through your folders with a file browser. When you open a terminal it should start in your main user directory. Your `Documents` folder will be a subdirectory of this user directory. The commands below would get you from the main user directory down into the directory containing the main course repo, and then pull the latest copy of the repo from Github, assuming you use the same directory names suggested above (*Note: The $ just indicates a terminal command. You do not type this in.*),

```
$ cd Documents
$ cd Math-modeling-2020
$ git pull 
```
Note, this will only work after you have created a local copy of the repo (see next section).

If you then wanted to change into your own code repo directory (from the main course one), you could use the commands:

```
$ cd ..
$ cd my-math-modeling-code
```

Then you could enter git commands for your repo. Note `..` means next directory up in the structure. So, when you are in one of the repo directories, `..` refers to the `Math-modeling` directory. If you were in the `Math-modeling` directory, it would refer to the `Documents` directory. 

You can also string together directory names with a `/`, so that, for example the first commands shown above could be shorted into:

```
$ cd Documents/Math-modeling-2020
$ git pull 
```
In most terminals, you can also use `Tab` to auto-complete folder and file names. Try partially typing in a folder name and then hitting `Tab`. 

### Forking the main course repo

*Updated directions: Rather than forking the main course repository, as originally described, I suggest that you simply clone the repo. From the Git Bash terminal you can do this by first using `cd` to navigate to the folder that you want to contain your repository (the repository will download into a subfolder in this folder). Then use `git clone` with the clone https link from Github. For example:*

```
$ cd Documents/Math-modeling
$ git clone https://github.com/speleophysics/Math-modeling-2020.git
```

*That's it! Now you should be able to use `git pull` from the Math-modeling-2020 directory in order to update to the lastest version. Note, if you ever accidentally edit code in the main course repo and have trouble with pulling the latest version, you can run:*

```
$ cd Documents/Math-modeling/Math-modeling-2020/
$ git stash
$ git pull
```

*Alternatively, worst case, just delete the whole folder that contains the main course repo and clone it afresh.*

It will be easiest to deal with this repo if you don't actually edit the code within in. If you want to mess around with code from the main course repo, I suggest you copy the specific files over into your own repo before editing. You can use `$ git pull` from a terminal in the directory containing the repo in order to download the most recent updates to the main course repo. Alternatively, you can also use the Git GUI or the Git interface found in VS Code, which we will use frequently in class.

### Creating your own course repo

To create your own repo for the course, where you will store all of your own code, follow the instructions in Git-it for creating a repository. These instructions have you create `hello-world`. Here you will just substitute the name for your repo in the place of `hello-world`, i.e., you could use `my-math-modeling-code`.

## Intro to python

Once you have installed Anaconda, VS Code, and Git, and have created the two course repos, then you can run through the Jupyter Notebook file that contains a very quick intro to Python. 

1. You will find this in the `Math-modeling-2020` repo in the directory labeled `intro`, with the file name `A-quick-and-dirty-python-intro.ipynb`. 

1. Copy this file over into your own repo. You can put it into a subfolder named `intro` if you want. 

1. Open VS Code and click on **File -- Open Folder**. Navigate to the folder containing your own course repo and open it.

1. Use the Explorer panel in VS Code to navigate to `A-quick-and-dirty-python-intro.ipynb` and open it.

1. When you open it, it will tell you to Select Python Interpreter. You may only have one option, but, if you have more than one, you are looking for something like `'base':conda` or `anaconda3`. The python version should be 3.x.

1. Start at the top and run through the code in the Notebook. You can runs cells of code by clicking on the *green play button* by the cell, or by clicking on the code in the cell so that the cursor is in the cell and then pressing `Shift-Enter`. If you are already familiar with Python, the contents of the Notebook will probably not be anything new. However, going through this quick exercise assures that your VS Code setup is working.
